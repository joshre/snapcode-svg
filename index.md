# Snapcode SVG
Snapchat is confusing to add people on, but [snapcodes](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/ca/snapcode) are great. This is a "tool" to get your snapcode as an SVG, so it can go anywhere.

Type in your username in the box and your snapcode will be generated ðŸ¤˜. This isn't complicated, fancy, or even good code. It's just using URL's from their ["add me on snapchat" page](https://www.snapchat.com/add/joshre)

<form id="snapz" action="index_submit" method="get" accept-charset="utf-8">
    <label for="username">Username</label><br>
    <input type="text" name="username" value="" placeholder="username">
    <input type="submit" name="" value="Go">
</form>
